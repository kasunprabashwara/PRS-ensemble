This script outlines the strategy for hyperparameter tuning and evaluation.
A full implementation of nested cross-validation for tuning base models and then
the ensemble is complex. Your proposal mentions "extensive cross-validation will be employed."

Simplified Strategy (as per your proposal's spirit and common practice):
1.  Split primary dataset (e.g., UK Biobank) into Train, Validation, Test sets.
    (Already done in 01_data_preprocessing.py conceptually by creating ID files).

2.  Hyperparameter Tuning for Base Models (using Train and Validation sets):
    *   LDpred2:
        *   The 'auto' mode does some internal optimization.
        *   For 'grid' mode, you'd iterate through `p_causal_seq` (and `h2_init` if desired).
        *   Train LDpred2 models on the *Train set IDs* for each hyperparameter combination.
        *   Calculate PRS for the *Validation set IDs*.
        *   Evaluate performance (e.g., AUC or R^2) on the Validation set.
        *   Select the best hyperparameters for LDpred2.
        *   Re-train LDpred2 on the (Train + Validation) set using best params OR just use model from Train set.
            The former is common if Validation set is small. If Validation is large enough for robust selection,
            using the model from Train set for generating PRS for ensemble training is fine.
    *   Penalized Regression (PROSPER-like):
        *   `ElasticNetCV` / `LogisticRegressionCV` already does internal CV for alpha/l1_ratio.
        *   You provide `config.PENREG_CV_FOLDS` and `config.ELASTICNET_L1_RATIOS`.
        *   This is trained on the *Train set IDs*. The internal CV uses folds *within* this Train set.
        *   No separate validation step needed for these specific hyperparameters if using the CV versions.
    *   MegaPRS:
        *   If it has hyperparameters, follow a similar procedure to LDpred2 (Train on Train, Eval on Valid).

3.  Generate Final Base PRS for Ensemble Training:
    *   Using the *optimal hyperparameters* found in step 2 for each base method:
        *   Train each base model on the *Train set IDs*.
        *   Calculate PRS scores from each base model for individuals in the *Train set IDs*. These scores become
          the features for training the ensemble model.
        *   Also, calculate PRS scores from each base model for individuals in the *Validation set IDs*. These
          will be used to tune the ensemble model's hyperparameters if needed (though ElasticNetCV does it).
        *   And for individuals in the *Test set IDs* (for final unbiased evaluation later).


4.  Hyperparameter Tuning for Ensemble Model (ElasticNet):
    *   The `train_ensemble` function using `(Logistic)ElasticNetCV` already performs
      hyperparameter tuning for the ensemble's own alpha and l1_ratio using
      `config.CV_FOLDS_ENSEMBLE` on the *input data* it receives.
    *   Input data for ensemble training: Base PRS scores (from step 3) of *Train set IDs*,
      and their phenotypes/covariates.

5.  Final Model Training:
    *   Train the chosen base models (with their optimal hyperparameters) on a larger dataset if desired,
      e.g., (Train + Validation sets). Then generate PRS from these models.
    *   Train the ensemble model (with its optimal hyperparameters) on the corresponding base PRS scores
      from this (Train + Validation set). This is your final, deployable ensemble model.
      Alternatively, and often simpler, stick to the models trained only on the initial Train set.

6.  Evaluation:
    *   On Test Set (e.g., UKB Test IDs):
        *   Generate base PRS scores using models trained on the Train (or Train+Valid) set.
        *   Apply the *final trained ensemble model* to these base PRS scores.
        *   Evaluate performance (AUC, R^2, etc.) against true phenotypes of the Test set.
    *   On Transfer/External Set (e.g., FinnGen):
        *   Generate base PRS scores using models trained on the original training cohort (e.g., UKB Train or Train+Valid).
        *   Apply the *final trained ensemble model* (weights learned from UKB) to these base PRS scores.
        *   Evaluate performance against true phenotypes of the FinnGen set.

This script will not execute a full nested CV but will point to where these steps happen
in other scripts.

    # This script is more of a conceptual guide.
    # You would typically run the individual scripts (01, 02a, 02b, 02c, 03, 06) in order,
    # ensuring that ID files for train/validation/test splits are used correctly at each stage
    # to generate the necessary intermediate PRS files.
    
    # Example workflow:
    # 1. `python scripts/01_data_preprocessing.py` (Ensure ID split files are created)
    #
    # 2. For each base model (LDpred2, PenReg, MegaPRS):
    #    Run their respective scripts (02a, 02b, 02c) multiple times, changing:
    #    - `keep_target_ids_file` to point to `config.UKB_TRAIN_IDS_FILE`
    #    - `output_prs_file` / `output_prs_file_prefix` to save with a "train" tag.
    #    Then repeat for `config.UKB_VALID_IDS_FILE` (output with "valid" tag).
    #    Then repeat for `config.UKB_TEST_IDS_FILE` (output with "test" tag).
    #    Then repeat for FinnGen IDs (output with "finngen" tag).
    #    (This is where hyperparameter tuning for base models using the validation set would occur if needed).
    #
    # 3. `python scripts/03_ensemble_model.py`
    #    - The `train_ensemble` part uses base PRS from the *training set* (e.g., `ukb_train_*.prs`).
    #    - The `calculate_ensemble_prs_on_new_data` part would then be called for:
    #        - UKB validation set (using `ukb_valid_*.prs` as input) -> output `ukb_valid_ensemble.prs`
    #        - UKB test set (using `ukb_test_*.prs` as input) -> output `ukb_test_ensemble.prs`
    #        - FinnGen set (using `finngen_*.prs` as input) -> output `finngen_ensemble.prs`
    #
    # 4. `python scripts/06_validation_transferability.py`
    #    - This script would load the final ensemble PRS files (e.g., `ukb_test_ensemble.prs`, `finngen_ensemble.prs`)
    #      and the corresponding phenotype files to calculate and report metrics.
    #
    # 5. `python scripts/05_interpretability.py`
    #    - This uses the saved ensemble model coefficients and potentially SHAP on specific models.
